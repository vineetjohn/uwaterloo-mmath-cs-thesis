\section{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsection{Cycle Loss}

Cycle loss is not a good metric because while transferring from $X$ to $Y$, and back to $X'$, the variable $Y$ is not observable and if the neural network function is accidentally fitted to transform the content domain, this metric will not be able to tell the difference between an over-fit model and a good model.
