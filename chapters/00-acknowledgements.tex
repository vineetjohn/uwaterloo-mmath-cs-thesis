I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor, Dr. Olga Vechtomova, without whom none of this would be possible. Her constant guidance and feedback have been indispensable to my learning and progress, and she has been a continuous source of ideas and inspiration that have been instrumental in the research work presented in this thesis. I'm grateful to Dr. Pascal Poupart and Dr. Mei Nagappan for agreeing to be readers on my thesis committee.

I would also like to thank Dr. Lili Mou, Hareesh Bahuleyan and Ankit Vadehra for the stimulating discussions we have had, and the work done together.

Finally, I extend my gratitude to my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement.
