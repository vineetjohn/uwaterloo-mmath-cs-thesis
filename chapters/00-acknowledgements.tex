I would like to begin by thanking my supervisor, Dr. Olga Vechtomova, without whom none of this would be possible. Her constant guidance, feedback and knowledge have been indispensable to my learning and progress, and she has been a continuous source of ideas and inspiration that has been instrumental in the research work presented in this thesis. I'm grateful to Dr. Pascal Poupart and Dr. Meiyappan (Mei) Nagappan for agreeing to be a readers on my thesis committee and providing valuable feedback.

I would also like to thank Dr. Lili Mou, Hareesh Bahuleyan and Ankit Vadehra for the stimulating discussions we have had, and the work done together.

Finally, I also thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout the duration of my time here.
